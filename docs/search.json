    "text": "This collection of Shell2R scripts is designed to streamline the processing and analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data generated with 10x Genomics platforms. The scripts automate key steps in the data workflow, from raw data handling to quality control, normalization, clustering, and downstream analysis.\nDeveloped within the context of studying Sézary syndrome heterogeneity, these scripts facilitate reproducible, scalable, and efficient bioinformatics pipelines specifically tailored for cancer genomics and immunophenotyping studies.\nThe goal is to provide an accessible and modular toolkit for researchers working on complex single-cell datasets, enabling rigorous exploration of tumor cell subpopulations and immune microenvironment interactions."
